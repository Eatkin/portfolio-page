            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>DOScord was created as a way to practice dynamic website creation using JavaScript. It aims to emulate
                the functionality of Discord, but with a fun DOS theme.</p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Website Structure</h5>
            <p>DOScord uses the CSS-grid layout to clearly define container areas within the page. This allows for
                easy, responsive design, and allows for the page to be easily split into sections.</p>

            </figure>

            <h5>Dynamic Content</h5>
            <p>As with Discord, DOScord is divided into servers and channels, with each channel containing a number of
                messages. The content of each channel is dynamically generated using JavaScript. The data is sourced
                from several linked JSON files, which are parsed and used to generate the content as needed.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>DOScord was a great opportunity to practise working with JavaScript and a complex structure of JSON data.
                This allowed me to create a dynamic website with a clear structure, which I have been able to bring
                forward to future projects, such as the use of dynamic content on this website.</p>

            <h5>Future Plans</h5>
            <p>DOScord is currently a work in progress, with plans to add more content to the page for users to explore,
                along with additional features such as user profiles.</p>
