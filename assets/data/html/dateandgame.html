            <h3>Date and Game</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p><i>Date &amp; Game</i> is a company integrating online games and dating into one app. Users match
                with other users and connect to play games together.</p>
            <p>I was the lead games programmer for the company, in charge of creating the online game framework to
                integrate with the <i>Date &amp; Game</i> API and programming gameplay.</p>
            <p>I collaborated with the app developers for API integration and worked alongside game designers and
                artists to create bespoke, two player experiences.</p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Online Games</h5>
            <p>I produced a robust framework using Gamemaker Studio 2 and Socket IO as the basis for all games.</p>
            <p>I created a variety of different games from <i>Route 69</i>, a game where players go on an adventure
                together, collecting key items to solve puzzles, to <i>PixlWave</i>, a vaporwave stylised game where
                players compete to complete pixel art drawings as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>

            <h5>Framework</h5>
            <p>To streamline the game development pipeline, I create an online game framework with a high level of
                modularity, allowing for the creation of new games with minimal effort. The basic framework allows
                players to send position and other variable updates and also keeps the game's world state synchronised,
                allowing for arbitrary resynchronisation - for example, if one player leaves the game, they are able to
                return and have the game state resynchronise so both players see the game in the same state.</p>

            <h5>Technical Details</h5>
            <p>Online games pose their own unique problems due to latency. For example, one player may pick up an item,
                then the other player may pick up the same item before the signal that the item has been picked up.
                These sort of conflicts arise constantly and methods must be implemented for clean resolution.</p>
            <p>I implemented various techniques to ensure the robustness of the framework and to optimise performance.
                This involved the use of three way handshakes, exponential backoff and data-encoding.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/dungeondate.png" alt="Dungeon Date" \>
                <figcaption>In <i>Dungeon Date</i>, players collaborate to escape the dungeon, choosing how to split
                    their loot.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Data management was crucial, due to the requirement of arbitrary resychronisation. Data structures were
                put in place along with encoding methods to allow players to seamlessly send large amounts of data
                easily and only where necessary.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>Despite initially having no experience with online game development and having a steep learning curve
                before me, I created robust systems and used creative problem solving to resolve any conflicts that
                arise as a result of latency to ensure smooth synchronisation of the games I developed.</p>
            <p>I also transferred the systems from Gamemaker Studio 2 to Unity, a system for which I previously had
                little familiarity with.</p>
