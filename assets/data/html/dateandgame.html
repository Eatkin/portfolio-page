            <h3>Date and Game</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>Date and Game is a company aiming to integrate online games into a dating app. Users can match with other
                users and connect to play games together.</p>
            <p>I was the lead games programmer for the company, in charge of creating the online game framework to
                integrate with the Date &amp; Game API and programming gameplay.</p>
            <p>I collaborated with game designers and artists to create bespoke, two player experiences, and also
                collaborated with the app developers for API integration.</p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Online Games</h5>
            <p>I produced a robust framework using Gamemaker Studio 2 and Socket IO as the basis for all games.</p>
            <p>I created a variety of different games from Route 69, a game where players adventure together, collecting
                key items to solve puzzles, to PixlWave, a vaporwave stylised game where players compete to complete
                pixel art drawings as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>

            <h5>Framework</h5>
            <p>I developed the online game framework to be as modular as possible, allowing for the creation of new
                games with minimal effort. The basic framework allows players to send position updates and send variable
                updates. It also keeps the game's world state synchronised, allowing for arbitrary resynchronisation -
                e.g. if one player leaves the game, they are able to return and have the game state synchronised between
                players.</p>
            <p>The framework also allows arbitrary resychronisation of games. If one player leaves the game, they should
                be able to return to the game at any point.</p>

            <h5>Technical Details</h5>
            <p>I implemented various techniques to ensure the robustness of the framework and to optimise performance.
                This involved the use of three way handshakes, exponential backoff and data-encoding.</p>

                <figcaption>In <i>Dungeon Date</i>, players collaborate to escape the dungeon, choosing how to split
                    their loot.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Data management was crucial, due to the requirement of arbitrary resychronisation. Data structures were
                put in place along with encoding methods to allow players to seamlessly send large amounts of data
                easily and as necessary.</p>
            <p>Online games pose their own unique problems due to latency. For example, one player may pick up an item,
                then the other player may pick up the same item before the signal that the item has been picked up.
                These sort of conflicts arise constantly and methods must be implemented for clean resolution.</p>


            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>I initially had no experience with the creation of online games, so in spite the massive learning curve
                before me, I created robust systems and used creative problem solving to resolve any conflicts that
                arise as a result of latency and to ensure smooth synchronisation of the games.</p>
            <p>I also transferred the systems from Gamemaker Studio 2 to Unity, a system for which I have little
                familiarity with.</p>
