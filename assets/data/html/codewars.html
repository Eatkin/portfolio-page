            <h3>Codewars Web Scraper and Data Visualisation</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>I have been using coding problems to further my technical capabilities since I started
                learning Python and also use them as a way to explore new languages and paradigms.</p>
            <p>My platform of choice is <i><a href="https://www.codewars.com/about" target="_blank">Codewars</a></i>,
                and as I racked up solutions I wanted a way to be able to extract them all.</p>
            <p>As I was learning new concepts with Le Wagon, I decided to use this as an opportunity to build a web
                scraper and data visualisation project with my newly learnt skills.</p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Project Objectives</h5>
            <p>The primary goal of this project is to build a customised web scraper for retrieving <i>Codewars</i>
                problem
                solutions and create an interactive data visualisation notebook to accompany the problems.</p>
            <h5>Data Collection</h5>
            <p>Initially I built a static webscraper, requiring me to preload the page with the number of
                problems I wanted to scrape and save it locally. <i>Codewars</i> loads solutions dynamically, so as I
                solved
                more problems, this became more cumbersome.</p>
            <p>I later updated the scraper to use <i>Selenium</i> to login to <i>Codewars</i> using a headless browser
                and
                simulate scrolling to the bottom of the page. <i>Beautiful Soup</i> then parses all the problems, which
                are
                saved locally and organised into folders based on the problem's programming language.</p>

                <figcaption>The Codewars Scraper is a command line based Python program</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h5>Data Visualisation</h5>
            <p>Instead of just leaving these scraped problems to sit archived on my hard disk, I decided to
                bring it to life by creating a <i>Jupyter Notebook</i> to visualise the data and explore interesting
                features.
            </p>
            <p>By employing libraries such as <i>Matplotlib</i> and <i>Seaborn</i>, I'm able to visualise my problem
                solving behaviour over time.</p>

                    alt="Chart showing distribution of difficulties for each programming language" />
                <figcaption>Chart showing distribution of difficulties for each programming language
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>For example, I can see how many problems I solved each day, how many problems I solved in
                each language, and how many problems I solved in each difficulty.</p>
            <p>I also use the <i>Codewars</i> API to collect additional information about problems, which allows me
                to uncover novel insights such as the <i>'rarest kata'</i>, the <i>Codewars</i> problem I've solved that
                has
                the least
                solved, or the <i>'most difficult kata'</i>; the <i>Codewars</i> problem that has the lowest rate of
                completion.</p>

            <h5>Impact and Future Steps</h5>
            <p>This project forms the foundation for future explorations in coding challenges and data
                analysis.
            </p>
            <p>The Jupyter Notebook can handle problems dynamically, meaning it is self-updating as I solve
                more problems.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>My Codewars Web Scraper and Data Visualisation project shows my passion for coding, data
                exploration, and problem-solving.</p>
            <p>The <i>Jupyter Notebook</i> is a great way to visualise the progress I've made and I look forward to
                continuing to use it as I solve more problems.</p>

            <h6>Further Development</h6>
            <p>The <i>Codewars</i> scraper does not include any error trapping for if the user enters incorrect
                login credentials or if the scraper is comes across an unexpected programming language, as
                detailed below.</p>
            <p>The <i>Codewars</i> scraper contains a Python dictionary which matches programming languages to file
                extensions
                and comment syntax. This only contains the programming languages I have used on <i>Codewars</i> and may
                be
                extended to contain details for all programming languages <i>Codewars</i> offers.</p>
