    <h3><a href="https://eatkin.neocities.org/blog" target="_blank">Edward Atkin's Blog</a></h3>
    <p>This is my personal blog I use for writing about life annecdotes, memories and personal reflection.</p>
    <p>Examples include <i>
            <a href="https://eatkin.neocities.org/txt/blog/2023/April/bananas" target="_blank">In Which I
                Break Free From My Sister's Banana Boycott</a></i>, the story of how I didn't
        eat bananas for 25 years because my sister didn't like them, and <i>
            <a href="https://eatkin.neocities.org/txt/blog/2023/July/dustydrawers" target="_blank">On The Dusty Drawers
                of
                Abandoned Hobbies</a></i>, a reflection on hobbies I felt very enthusiastic for, only for them to be
        left to
        gather dust.</p>
