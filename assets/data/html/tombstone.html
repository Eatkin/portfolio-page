            <h3>Tombstone Tapes</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>I was tasked with creating a bespoke website to accompany small business <i>Tombstone Tapes</i>. To fit
                with the retro feel of redundant data formats, we decided to look back to the past and create a website
                inspired by Windows 95.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/paintcontainer.png" alt="An MS Paint style image container" \>
                <figcaption>The website's containers take inspiration from Windows 95, with the image containers being
                    stylised after Paint</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Design</h5>
            <p>The design of the Tombstone Tapes homepage is inspired by Windows 95, with colours and fonts taken from
                the operating system.</p>
            <p>This gave us the opportunity to include fun elements on the website to interact with, such as a fully
                functional start menu complete with icons to external sites, displayed in 16-bit Windows colour palette,
                along with a real time clock along the task bar.</p>
            <p>The containers on the website are stylised after Windows 95 dialogue boxes, including image containers
                stylised after MS Paint containers.</p>
            <p>The website is fully responsive to work on mobile devices, and likewise the start menu is still fully
                functional.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>Tombstone Tapes was an exercise in creating a website with a specific design brief, and was a great
                opportunity to learn more about working with CSS and responsive design. Creating a bespoke interactive
                start menu allowed me to create some fun elements and experiment with some simple JavaScript.</p>
