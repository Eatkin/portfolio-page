            <h3>Tombstone Tapes</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p><i>Tombstone Tapes</i> is a small business creating bespoke, novel cassette tapes. Inspired by the
                redundant cassette tape format, we decided to look back to the past for inspiration and created a
                website stylised after Windows 95.</p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Design</h5>
            <p>The design of the Tombstone Tapes homepage is modelled after Windows 95, with colours and fonts emulating
                those from the operating system itself.</p>
            <p>This design choice opened up opporunities for fun elements on the website to interact with, such as a
                fully functional start menu, complete with icons to external sites and displayed in 16-bit Windows
                colour palette, along with a real time clock along the task bar.</p>
            <p>The containers on the website are Windows 95 dialogue boxes, including image containers
                stylised after MS Paint containers.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>Tombstone Tapes was an exercise in creating a website with a specific design brief. This website was not
                only a platform to develop new skills with CSS and responsive design, but was also an opporunity to work
                with interactive elements.</p>
            <p>By designing the website around Windows 95 user interface elements and crafting a bespoke, interactive
                start menu, I was able to develop my skills in Javascript, and create a unique website to promote a
                small, unique business.</p>
