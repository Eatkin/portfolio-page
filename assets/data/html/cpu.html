    <h3>Design a CPU</h3>
    <p>The Deisgn a CPU course provides a guide to building circuitry for an 16-bit CPU right through to executing
        Assembly code.</p>
    <p>Using freeware software Logisim, the course covers basic logic gates, building memory cells and registers and
        eventually building up to show how each individual component can be combined to create a full CPU.</p>
