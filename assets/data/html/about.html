<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a coding enthusiast who entered the world of digital creation at the age of 11, driven by a desire to
    bring my video game ideas to life.</p>
<p>With a dynamic array of technical skills, my educational background in Mathematical Physics drives my passion for
    programming and problem solving. From web development to data science, I'm always looking for fresh opportunities to
    stretch my abilities.</p>
<p>From the humble days of learning to code with Gamemaker 6 in the early 2000s, my path has brought me through
    to mastering the art of data science through Le Wagon's world-class data science bootcamp, and I'm now looking to
    apply my skills to a new challenge.</p>
