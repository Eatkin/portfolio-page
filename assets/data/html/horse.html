            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <p>My first step into the world of gambling was through matched betting - a no-risk methodology
                which uses Bookmaker offers to guarantee profits. This was what first sparked my interest in betting
                systems
                and technically-driven approaches to gambling.</p>
            <p>As gambling is addictive, it's very easy to become emotionally involved and make bad decisions. A
                robo-betting strategy provided by a machine learning model removes the emotional decision making.
                The bettor does not have to review racecards or analyse horses, nor do they need to analyse their wins
                and losses.</p>

            <h4>Key Features</h4>
            <ul class="bullet-points">
                <li>Automated data collection and racecard scraping</li>
                <li>Two machine learning models, a deep neural network and a random forest classifier, making
                    predictions</li>
                <li>Data dashboard to visualise daily predictions and provide interpretations</li>
            </ul>

                    Modelling complex data such as horse racing shows the difficulty in balancing precision and number
                    of predictions.
