                <h3>Other Minds</h3>
                <p>Project objective: a 2d platformer where players can take control of any other entity in
                    the
                    game.</p>

            <h3>Other Minds</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>Other Minds was conceptually influenced by philosophy. Inparticular, why are we
                ourselves? Why can't we know what it is to be
                other people? This is a concept in philosophy known as
                the problem of other minds - how do you know others experience consciousness?</p>
            <p>Other Minds is a game that explores this concept. You play as the main character Ed, who is
                accompanied by a floating green whisp called Sage who can possess other entities in the
                game. The player can then control these entities, and use their abilities to solve puzzles
                and progress through the game.</p>
            <p>It was heavily influenced by the classic Gamemaker indie game <a

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Modular Design</h5>
            <p>Other Minds is a relatively large, open world 2d platformer. Modular, re-usable code helped
                to streamline the development process and made the addition of new features simple.</p>
            <p>Since every character is controllable, their abilities are determined by variables
                dictating things such as speed, acceleration and jump height, alongside a list of boolean
                variables to determine which abilities are and are not available. Every character runs on
                the exact same script. Using a finite state machine, both the main character and various
                other characters, such as a bird, run on the same code, which demonstrates how powerful this
                concept is.</p>

            </figure>

            <h5>Character AI</h5>
            <p>Every character in the game should move in the same way whilst they have 'free will' and
                whilst the player is controlling them. To accomplish this, characters use simulated key
                presses to create movement. The game world is supposed to be full of characters who are able
                to exhibit behaviours, be it slimes who have fun jumping up and down, or a nervous character
                who paces back and forth. The use of simulating movement as if the player were controlling
                them allows this.</p>
            <p>Using some situational awareness, this can allow for extremely complex emergent behaviour for
                characters. Of note is the first boss fight of the game where the player faces antagonist Dr
                Death. Upon defeating his machines, Dr Death himself runs into the boss arena to try and
                attack you. He is able to determine which platforms he can reach and calculate which is best
                for reaching his target, the player. The emergent behaviour based on a few simple rules
                allows the AI to become very complex, and infact, I had to deliberately dumb down the
                behaviour and create 'mistakes' because the boss fight became way too difficult.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>Other Minds was my first large project after a long break from programming. Whilst this
                project does have somewhat organised code, my coding ability improved meaning that in future
                I could bring forward what I learnt. This is demonstrated in project such as <i><a
                        href="https://eatkin.itch.io/ben-was-assimilated" target="_blank">
                        Ben Was Assimilated
                    </a></i>, which made the process of adding new enemies or items to the game a
                case of adding one line of code, and the modularity of the code did the rest.</p>
            <p>The game also required careful management of data, for which I made use of bitmasking and
                data structures. Bitmasking is a powerful concept which I have used in almost every
                project since.</p>
            <p>This project also took place over the course of several years, and maintaining a project for
                that long can be difficult in terms of motivation.</p>

            <h5>The Future</h5>
            <p>Other Minds has now been shelved and no more work will be done on it. I have often considered
                making a sequel, or re-imagining, since my abilities have grown hugely since I first
                embarked on making this game. I would be able to combine everything I have learnt over the
                past few years to create a more immersive experience, with improved game mechanics and
                storytelling.</p>
            <p>The one large barrier is time - producing a project this large can take it's toll, especially
                when you are working fulltime alongside.</p>
