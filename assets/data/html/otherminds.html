            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> draws its roots from philosophy, specifically looking towards the question; why are we
                ourselves, and why is understanding the consciousness of others so difficult? This is a concept in
                philosophy aptly knows as the problem of other minds - how do you know others experience consciousness?
            </p>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> is an exploration of this concept. You inhabit a character known as Ed, accompanied by
                a floating prescence called Sage who allows you to possess other entities in the game. Through this
                unique mechanic, the player can step into the shoes of other characters, use them to solve puzzles and
                advance the narrative of the game.</p>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> draw influence from <i>
                    <a href="http://autofish.net/clysm/art/video_games/seiklus/index.html" target="_blank">Seiklus</a>
                </i>, a
                cornerstone of Gamemaker's legacy. By combining the influence of this game with innovative gameplay
                mechanics, <i>Other Minds</i> is a game which allows the player to explore the concepts of consciousness
                and embark on an exploratary adventure.</p>
