                <h3>Other Minds</h3>
                <p>Project objective: a 2d platformer where players can take control of any other entity in
                    the
                    game.</p>

            <h3>Other Minds</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> draws its roots from philosophy, specifically looking towards the question; why are we
                ourselves, and why is understanding the consciousness of others so difficult? This is a concept in
                philosophy aptly knows as the problem of other minds - how do you know others experience consciousness?
            </p>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> is an exploration of this concept. You inhabit a character known as Ed, accompanied by
                a
                floating prescence called Sage who allows you to possess other entities in the game. Through this unique
                mechanic, the player can step into the shoes of other characters, use them to solve puzzles and advance
                the narrative of the game.</p>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> draw influence from <i>
                    <a href="http://autofish.net/clysm/art/video_games/seiklus/index.html" target="_blank">Seiklus</a>
                </i>, a
                cornerstone of Gamemaker's legacy. By combining the influence of this game with innovative gameplay
                mechanics, <i>Other Minds</i> is a game which allows the player to explore the concepts of consciousness
                and embark on an exploratary adventure.</p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Modular Design</h5>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> is an expansive, open world 2d platformer. Modular, re-usable code was essential for
                streamlining the development process and allowing the game to be both scalable and amenable to the
                addition of new features.</p>
            <p>As the player is free to control any character, their abilities are determined by variables
                dictating speed, acceleration and jump height, alongside a list of boolean variables to determine which
                skills are accessible. Using a finite state machine, both the main character and various
                other characters, such as a bird, run on the same code, demonstrating how powerful this concept is.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <h5>Character AI</h5>
            <p>Character movement should be consistent whether the character has 'free will' or if the player is
                controlling them. To accomplish this, characters use simulated key presses to create movement. The game
                world is full of characters who are able to exhibit their unique behaviours and personalities, be it
                slimes who have fun jumping up and down, or a nervous character who paces back and forth. The use of
                simulating movement as if the player were controlling them allows this.</p>
            <p>This concept can allow for extremely complex emergent behaviour for characters. Of note is the first boss
                fight of the game where the player faces antagonist Dr Death. Upon defeating his machines, Dr Death
                himself runs into the boss arena to try and attack you. He is able to determine which platforms he can
                reach and calculate which is best for reaching his target; the player. A few simple rules allows the AI
                to become very complex.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> was my first large project after a long programming hiatus. Whilst this
                project does have somewhat organised code, my coding ability, code modularity and project management
                vastly improved over the course of the development process. This improvement is demonstrated in project
                such as <i><a href="https://eatkin.itch.io/ben-was-assimilated" target="_blank">Ben Was
                        Assimilated</a></i>, which made the process of adding new enemies or items to the game a
                case of adding one line of code, with the modular systems managing everything else.
            </p>
            <p>The game also required careful data management, for which I made use of bitmasking and
                data structures. Bitmasking is a powerful concept which I have used in almost every
                project since.</p>
            <p>The development process took place over the course of several years, and maintaining a project for
                that long can be difficult in terms of motivation. This taught me skills in large project management;
                maintaining an organised task list and breaking steps down into small, manageable chunks.</p>

            <h5>The Future</h5>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> has an unknown future as a concept and no more work will be done on the game itself,
                however I have often considered making a sequel, or re-imagining, since my abilities have grown hugely
                since I first embarked on making this game. I would be able to combine everything I have learnt over the
                past few years to create a more immersive experience, with improved game mechanics and storytelling.</p>
            <p>The one large barrier is time - producing a project this large as a solo developer can be extremely
                consuming, especially when you are working fulltime alongside.</p>
