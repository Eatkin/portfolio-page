            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>I have a lot of nostalgia for the days of Web 1.0, when the internet was more amateur and lots of people
                made their own websites on hosts like Geocities and Freewebs. These websites were flawed, however, they
                had a very personal touch.</p>
            <p>It was because of this I decided to use web hosting service <a href="https://neocities.org/"
                    target="_blank">Neocities</a>, the spiritual successor to Geocities.</p>
            <p>My website is a place to host things I have made, including my personal blog and my webcomic.</p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Neocities</h5>
            <p>Neocities is a free web hosting service that allows users to create their own websites. It is a
                successor to Geocities, a web hosting service that was popular in the 90s and early 2000s.</p>
            <p>When a user creates a site on Neocities, they are provided with one file, <i>index.html</i>.</p>
            <p>From there, the user can create more files and folders to create a website. This was the first steps I
                took into front end web development, and after many revisions, I have a website I'm happy with. The
                style is supposed to be simple and bold, with minimal javascript to maximise compatability.</p>

            <h5>Tools</h5>
            <p>As my site grew, I began to develop tools using Python to dynamically generate pages for me. For example,
                my games pages contains over 30 games with a variety of tags and CSS-based filtering. To create or
                update this page, I run a Python script which will automatically parse json data and generate html and
                accompanying css.</p>
            <p>Chronologically updating pages like my blog or webcomic also have accompanying tools to build pages,
                update links and create RSS feeds.</p>

            </figure>

            <h6>Neocities API</h6>
            <p>As my site grew, uploading pages manually became cumbersome, so I have built file-tracking and automation
                tools that use the Neocities API to update any pages that have changes. This means updating pages such
                as my blog become trivial, as I only need to run two scripts to build the pages and update the website.
            </p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>Neocities was my first foray into front end web development, and was the first project that took my
                interest in web development in general. From here I have built up the website and accompanying
                automation tools to streamline the process of building and updating the website, and have completed
                several other web development projects since.</p>
