            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>Over the years I've worked on a lot of games, pieces of music, and other projects, and I wanted a
                place to host and write about these projects.</p>
            <p>I have deep sense of nostalgia for the Web 1.0 era, a time when hosts like <i>Freewebs</i> and
                <i>Geocities</i> proliferated. These websites had a charming, amateur quality with a distinct personal
                touch which left an impression on the viewer.
            </p>
            <p>Inspired by this, I chose to use web hosting service <i>
                    <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank">Neocities</a>
                </i>, the spiritual successor to <i>Geocities</i>.</p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Neocities</h5>
            <p><i>Neocities</i> is a free web hosting service that allows users to create their own websites. It is a
                successor to <i>Geocities</i>, a web hosting service that was popular in the 90s and early 2000s.</p>
            <p>When a user creates a site on <i>Neocities</i>, they are provided with one file, <i>index.html</i>.</p>
            <p>From there, the user can create more files and folders to build up a website. These were the first steps
                I took into front end web development, creating a simple and bold site, with minimal javascript to
                maximise compatability.</p>

            <h5>Tools</h5>
            <p>As my site grew, I developed tools in Python to dynamically generate pages for me. For example,
                my games pages contains over 30 games with a variety of tags and CSS-based filtering. To create or
                update this page, I run a Python script which will automatically parse json data and generate html and
                accompanying css.</p>
            <p>Chronologically updated pages such as my blog also have accompanying tools to automate building
                pages and updating links and RSS feeds.</p>

            </figure>

            <h5>Neocities API</h5>
            <p>As my site grew, uploading pages manually became cumbersome, so I have built file-tracking and automation
                tools that use the <i>Neocities</i> API to update any pages as necessary. Site updates are now as simple
                as running a Python script.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>Neocities was my first foray into front end web development, and was the cornerstone of my
                interest in web development in general. From here I have built up the website and accompanying
                automation tools to streamline the process of web development and deployment, and this has been the
                foundation I needed to continue working with web development projects.</p>
