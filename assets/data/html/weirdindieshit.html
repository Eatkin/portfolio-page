            Weird Indie Shit
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>Being an indie game developer has given me experience in the sheer difficulty of getting your games noticed. As
        programming video games becomes increasingly accessible, the rate at which games are uploaded is constantly
        accelerating.</p>
    <p>Upon making the observation that several hundred games are uploaded to <a href="https://www.itch.io/"
            target="_blank"><i>Itch io</i></a> every day, most of
        which would never be seen or played, I decided to embark on some indie game archaeology to discuss a few games
        that nobody has ever heard of.</p>
