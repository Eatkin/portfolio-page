            <h3>Reddit Sentiment Analysis</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Project Outline</h5>
            <p>This project was our final group project at the Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp.</p>
            <p>Reddit is a social media platform where users can post content and interact with other users. It is a
                popular platform for discussion, with many subreddits dedicated to specific topics.</p>
            <p>The project outline was to analyse the sentiment and emotion of Reddit comments, specifically those
                posted on the infamous Wall Street Bets subreddit, which is dedicated to stock market discussion.</p>
            <p>The project was inspired by the recent GameStop short squeeze, which was driven by the Wall Street Bets
                subreddit.</p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Objectives</h5>
            <p>Create a system for collecting Reddit comments, then analyse the sentiment and emotion of the comments
                using Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p>
            <p>Present the results in a dashboard, which can be used to track the sentiment and emotion of the subreddit
                over time.</p>

            <h5>Under the Hood</h5>
            <p>The backend for the project for data collection and processing was written in Python, using the PRAW
                library for interacting with the Reddit API.</p>
            <p>Modelling was performed using transformers, a library for NLP tasks.</p>
            <p>The dashboard was created using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive dashboards.</p>
            <p>An API was created using FastAPI to allow the dashboard to interact with the backend.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>This was my first experience of working on a group project, and aside from developing technical skills,
                it was a great opportunity to develop soft skills such as communication and teamwork.</p>
            <p>This was also my first experience of working on a live product, and as such I worked closely with
                deployment tools such as Docker and Google Cloud Platform services.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, this project introduced me to the practical side of data science, demonstrating how
                technical proficiency intertwines with user experience, performance optimisation, and scalability.</p>
            <p>The challenges of creating a live, dynamic project honed my problem-solving skills and deepened my
                understanding of cloud-based solutions.</p>

            <h5>The Future</h5>
            <h6>Further Development Potential</h6>
            <p>As this was a short lived project during a part time bootcamp, there is plenty of scope for further
                development.</p>
            <p>An automated data processing system proved to be a challenge, as the operations were very intensive and
                time consuming, meaning running this on Google Cloud Run was not feasible.</p>
            <p>The project could also benefit from utilising a cloud based database system such as Google BigQuery,
                which would
                allow for more efficient data storage and retrieval and allow the dashboard to be updated in real time.
            </p>
            <p>To enhance scalability and automation, Kubernetes could be explored for container orchestration.
                Leveraging Kubernetes would not only ensure the smooth operation of the project but also facilitate
                fully automated processes, reducing the need for manual intervention.</p>
