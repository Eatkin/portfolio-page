            <h3>Horse Racing Predictor</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>My first step into the world of gambling was through matched betting - a no-risk methodology
                which uses Bookmaker offers to guarantee profits. This was what sparked my interest in betting systems
                and technically-driven approaches to gambling.</p>
            <p>Le Wagon's Data Science bootcamp connected me with other people who were interested in sports
                betting algorithms, and my interest was piqued once again.</p>

            <h5>Advantages of Machine Learning Methods</h5>
            <p>As gambling can be addictive, it is very easy to become emotionally involved and make bad decisions. A
                robo-betting strategy provided by a machine learning model removes the emotional decision making.
                The bettor does not have to review racecards or analyse horses, nor do they need to analyse their wins
                and losses.</p>
            <p>Although emotions are not completely removed, a machine learning driven methodology allows the bettor to
                focus on the long-term and not be swayed by short-term losses.</p>

            </figure>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Objectives</h5>
            <p>Create a model that is able to predict the outcome of horse races.</p>
            <p>Develop a betting strategy that can leverage the model's predictions to make a profit.</p>

            <h5>Data Collection</h5>
            <p>Horse racing data is difficult to find, with only a few patchy datasets on Kaggle
                available.</p>
            <p>Searching Github, I came across <a href="https://github.com/joenano/rpscrape"
                    target="_blank">RPScrape</a>, a utility for scraping results from Racing Post. From this I gathered
                around 1.5 million datapoints for use in exploratory data analysis model training.</p>
            <p>Using this, I have built automated systems which will scrape results daily, as up-to-date data is crucial
                for accurate model predictions.</p>

            <h5>Data Processing</h5>
            <p>Horse racing data in isolation is almost useless, with no features correlating with a horse
                winning. To begin making sense of all the data, it requires history and context.</p>
            <p>I engineered various features using <i>Pandas</i> built-in aggregation utilities, including
                aggregations of horse's performance over its lifetime, alongside comparisons with its
                competitors within a race.</p>

            <h5>Model Training</h5>
            <p>As horse racing is notoriously difficult to predict with any consistency, machine learning
                models suffer likewise, with overfitting being a major issue.</p>
            <p>My benchmark for a model was defined by by running a simulation which randomly picked one horse from
                every race, resulting in a 13% success rate.</p>
            <p>I have trained two separate models, a deep neural network and a random forest classifier, which are both
                able to capture complex relationships within data.</p>
            <p>By carefully balancing parameters, the neural network is able to predict winners with around 25%
                Precision, which is a mild success when compared to the benchmark.</p>
            <p>My second model, using ensemble machine learning algorithms, allowed my model to hit around 60% precision
                predicting winners, but at the cost of providing a winning candidate only once a week on average.
            </p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Does It Make Money? The Short Answer</h5>
            <p>Using a well defined betting strategy, my model is able to make a profit over time.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/candlesticks.png" alt="Candlestick chart showing profit over time" \>
                <figcaption>Candlesticks chart showing profit based on level Â£1 stakes
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h5>Does It Make Money? The Long Answer</h5>
            <p>Whilst trialling betting strategies over my dataset, I found that merely randomly picking a horse from
                each race can occassionally result in enormous profits (although most of the time it results in a loss).
            </p>
            <p>There is no way to tell if the betting strategy is going to be successful forever, it is merely that
                confidence increases the longer it is profitable.</p>

            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>This project was a huge exercise in taking data with almost no meaningful features and
                turning it into something useful.</p>
            <p>Upon completing my first model, which took me around a month, I found the results to be
                disappointing. At this point, it would have been easy to give up and move on, but I instead tried to
                further my domain knowledge in horse racing, which lead to reading about the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyer_Speed_Figure" , target="_blank">Bayer Speed
                    Figures</a> used in Hong Kong races. Inspired by this I
                created my own speed ratings to benchmark horses against, and this proved to be a crucial
                piece of the puzzle.</p>
            <p>This project is also the first time I have ensembled multiple models in order to play on the
                strengths of both. This works well with the domain of horse racing, as the difficulty in
                making consistent predictions means both models may complement each other. If one model
                performs poorly one day, the second model may be there to make up for it, and using results that both
                models agree on can be a good indicator of a strong candidate.</p>

            <h5>The Future</h5>
            <h6>Automation</h6>
            <p>This project is already automated to the point where a single Bash script will gather
                results and racecards, then perform data processing and modelling and finally email the
                relevant results to me so I have access to them remotely.</p>
            <p>This may be further automated with use of the cron utility and a system such as a Raspberry
                Pi to host the service.</p>
            <p>While bets are currently manually placed, Betfair Exchange has an API which can be utilised
                to automate betting.</p>

            <h3>Codewars Web Scraper and Data Visualisation</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>I have been using coding problems to further my technical capabilities since I started
                learning Python. I also use them as a way to explore new languages and paradigms.</p>
            <p>My platform of choice is <a href="https://www.codewars.com/about" target="_blank">Codewars</a>,
                and as I racked up solutions I wanted a way to be able to extract them all.</p>
            <p>As I was learning new concepts with Le Wagon, I decided to use this as an opportunity to build a web
                scraper and data visualisation project with my newly learnt skills.</p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Project Objectives</h5>
            <p>The primary goal of this project is to build a customised web scraper for retrieving Codewars problem
                solutions and create an interactive data visualisation notebook to accompany the problems.</p>
            <h5>Data Collection</h5>
            <p>Initially I built a static webscraper, requiring me to preload the page with the number of
                problems I wanted to scrape and save it locally. Codewars loads solutions dynamically, so as I solved
                more problems, this became more cumbersome.</p>
            <p>I later updated the scraper to use Selenium to login to Codewars using a headless browser and
                simulate scrolling to the bottom of the page. <i>Beautiful Soup</i> then parses all the problems, which
                are
                saved locally and organised into folders based on the problem's programming language.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/codewarsScraper.png" alt="Codewars scraper running in command line" />
                <figcaption>The Codewars Scraper is a command line based Python program</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h5>Data Visualisation</h5>
            <p>Instead of just leaving these scraped problems to sit archived on my hard disk, I decided to
                bring it to life by creating a Jupyter Notebook to visualise the data and explore interesting features.
            </p>
            <p>By employing libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I'm able to visualise my problem
                solving behaviour over time.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/codewarsDifficultyChart.png"
                    alt="Chart showing distribution of difficulties for each programming language" />
                <figcaption>Chart showing distribution of difficulties for each programming language
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>For example, I can see how many problems I solved each day, how many problems I solved in
                each language, and how many problems I solved in each difficulty.</p>
            <p>I also use the Codewars API to collect additional information about problems, which allows me
                to uncover novel insights such as the <i>'rarest kata'</i>, the Codewars problem I've solved that has
                the least
                solved, or the <i>'most difficult kata'</i>; the Codewars problem that has the lowest rate of
                completion.</p>

            <h5>Impact and Future Steps</h5>
            <p>This project forms the foundation for future explorations in coding challenges and data
                analysis.
            </p>
            <p>The Jupyter Notebook can handle problems dynamically, meaning it is self-updating as I solve
                more problems.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>My Codewars Web Scraper and Data Visualisation project shows my passion for coding, data
                exploration, and problem-solving.</p>
            <p>The Jupyter Notebook is a great way to visualise the progress I've made and I look forward to
                continuing to use it as I solve more problems.</p>

            <h6>Further Development</h6>
            <p>The Codewars scraper does not include any error trapping for if the user enters incorrect
                login credentials or if the scraper is comes across an unexpected programming language, as
                detailed below.</p>
            <p>The Codewars scraper contains a Python dictionary which matches programming languages to file extensions
                and comment syntax. This only contains the programming languages I have used on Codewars and may be
                extended to contain details for all programming languages Codewars offers.</p>

                    game.</p>

            <h3>Other Minds</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>Other Minds was conceptually influenced by philosophy. Inparticular, why are we
                ourselves? Why can't we know what it is to be
                other people? This is a concept in philosophy known as
                the problem of other minds - how do you know others experience consciousness?</p>
            <p>Other Minds is a game that explores this concept. You play as the main character Ed, who is
                accompanied by a floating green whisp called Sage who can possess other entities in the
                game. The player can then control these entities, and use their abilities to solve puzzles
                and progress through the game.</p>
            <p>It was heavily influenced by the classic Gamemaker indie game <a
                    href="http://autofish.net/clysm/art/video_games/seiklus/index.html" target="_blank">Seiklus.</a></p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Modular Design</h5>
            <p>Other Minds is a relatively large, open world 2d platformer. Modular, re-usable code helped
                to streamline the development process and made the addition of new features simple.</p>
            <p>Since every character is controllable, their abilities are determined by variables
                dictating things such as speed, acceleration and jump height, alongside a list of boolean
                variables to determine which abilities are and are not available. Every character runs on
                the exact same script. Using a finite state machine, both the main character and various
                other characters, such as a bird, run on the same code, which demonstrates how powerful this
                concept is.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/otherMindsGif.gif" alt="A challenging scenario in Other Minds" />
                <figcaption>A challenging scenario in Other Minds</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h5>Character AI</h5>
            <p>Every character in the game should move in the same way whilst they have 'free will' and
                whilst the player is controlling them. To accomplish this, characters use simulated key
                presses to create movement. The game world is supposed to be full of characters who are able
                to exhibit behaviours, be it slimes who have fun jumping up and down, or a nervous character
                who paces back and forth. The use of simulating movement as if the player were controlling
                them allows this.</p>
            <p>Using some situational awareness, this can allow for extremely complex emergent behaviour for
                characters. Of note is the first boss fight of the game where the player faces antagonist Dr
                Death. Upon defeating his machines, Dr Death himself runs into the boss arena to try and
                attack you. He is able to determine which platforms he can reach and calculate which is best
                for reaching his target, the player. The emergent behaviour based on a few simple rules
                allows the AI to become very complex, and infact, I had to deliberately dumb down the
                behaviour and create 'mistakes' because the boss fight became way too difficult.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>Other Minds was my first large project after a long break from programming. Whilst this
                project does have somewhat organised code, my coding ability improved meaning that in future
                I could bring forward what I learnt. This is demonstrated in project such as <i><a
                        href="https://eatkin.itch.io/ben-was-assimilated" target="_blank">
                        Ben Was Assimilated
                    </a></i>, which made the process of adding new enemies or items to the game a
                case of adding one line of code, and the modularity of the code did the rest.</p>
            <p>The game also required careful management of data, for which I made use of bitmasking and
                data structures. Bitmasking is a powerful concept which I have used in almost every
                project since.</p>
            <p>This project also took place over the course of several years, and maintaining a project for
                that long can be difficult in terms of motivation.</p>

            <h5>The Future</h5>
            <p>Other Minds has now been shelved and no more work will be done on it. I have often considered
                making a sequel, or re-imagining, since my abilities have grown hugely since I first
                embarked on making this game. I would be able to combine everything I have learnt over the
                past few years to create a more immersive experience, with improved game mechanics and
                storytelling.</p>
            <p>The one large barrier is time - producing a project this large can take it's toll, especially
                when you are working fulltime alongside.</p>

            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>Date and Game is a company aiming to integrate online games into a dating app. Users can match with other
                users and connect to play games together.</p>
            <p>I was the lead games programmer for the company, in charge of creating the online game framework to
                integrate with the Date &amp; Game API and programming gameplay.</p>
            <p>I collaborated with game designers and artists to create bespoke, two player experiences, and also
                collaborated with the app developers for API integration.</p>

                    playing noughts and crosses together</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Online Games</h5>
            <p>I produced a robust framework using Gamemaker Studio 2 and Socket IO as the basis for all games.</p>
            <p>I created a variety of different games from Route 69, a game where players adventure together, collecting
                key items to solve puzzles, to PixlWave, a vaporwave stylised game where players compete to complete
                pixel art drawings as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>

            <h5>Framework</h5>
            <p>I developed the online game framework to be as modular as possible, allowing for the creation of new
                games with minimal effort. The basic framework allows players to send position updates and send variable
                updates. It also keeps the game's world state synchronised, allowing for arbitrary resynchronisation -
                e.g. if one player leaves the game, they are able to return and have the game state synchronised between
                players.</p>
            <p>The framework also allows arbitrary resychronisation of games. If one player leaves the game, they should
                be able to return to the game at any point.</p>

            <h5>Technical Details</h5>
            <p>I implemented various techniques to ensure the robustness of the framework and to optimise performance.
                This involved the use of three way handshakes, exponential backoff and data-encoding.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/dungeondate.png" alt="Dungeon Date" \>
                <figcaption>In <i>Dungeon Date</i>, players collaborate to escape the dungeon, choosing how to split
                    their loot.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Data management was crucial, due to the requirement of arbitrary resychronisation. Data structures were
                put in place along with encoding methods to allow players to seamlessly send large amounts of data
                easily and as necessary.</p>
            <p>Online games pose their own unique problems due to latency. For example, one player may pick up an item,
                then the other player may pick up the same item before the signal that the item has been picked up.
                These sort of conflicts arise constantly and methods must be implemented for clean resolution.</p>


            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>I initially had no experience with the creation of online games, so in spite the massive learning curve
                before me, I created robust systems and used creative problem solving to resolve any conflicts that
                arise as a result of latency and to ensure smooth synchronisation of the games.</p>
            <p>I also transferred the systems from Gamemaker Studio 2 to Unity, a system for which I have little
                familiarity with.</p>

            <h3>Personal Homepage</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>I have a lot of nostalgia for the days of Web 1.0, when the internet was more amateur and lots of people
                made their own websites on hosts like Geocities and Freewebs. These websites were flawed, however, they
                had a very personal touch.</p>
            <p>It was because of this I decided to use web hosting service <a href="https://neocities.org/"
                    target="_blank">Neocities</a>, the spiritual successor to Geocities.</p>
            <p>My website is a place to host things I have made, including my personal blog and my webcomic.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/blogpost.png" alt="Blog post" />
                <figcaption>An example of a blog post</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Neocities</h5>
            <p>Neocities is a free web hosting service that allows users to create their own websites. It is a
                successor to Geocities, a web hosting service that was popular in the 90s and early 2000s.</p>
            <p>When a user creates a site on Neocities, they are provided with one file, <i>index.html</i>.</p>
            <p>From there, the user can create more files and folders to create a website. This was the first steps I
                took into front end web development, and after many revisions, I have a website I'm happy with. The
                style is supposed to be simple and bold, with minimal javascript to maximise compatability.</p>

            <h5>Tools</h5>
            <p>As my site grew, I began to develop tools using Python to dynamically generate pages for me. For example,
                my games pages contains over 30 games with a variety of tags and CSS-based filtering. To create or
                update this page, I run a Python script which will automatically parse json data and generate html and
                accompanying css.</p>
            <p>Chronologically updating pages like my blog or webcomic also have accompanying tools to build pages,
                update links and create RSS feeds.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/games.png" alt="Games page" />
                <figcaption>An example of the games page with CSS-based filtering</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h6>Neocities API</h6>
            <p>As my site grew, uploading pages manually became cumbersome, so I have built file-tracking and automation
                tools that use the Neocities API to update any pages that have changes. This means updating pages such
                as my blog become trivial, as I only need to run two scripts to build the pages and update the website.
            </p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>Neocities was my first foray into front end web development, and was the first project that took my
                interest in web development in general. From here I have built up the website and accompanying
                automation tools to streamline the process of building and updating the website, and have completed
                several other web development projects since.</p>

            <h3>Tombstone Tapes</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>I was tasked with creating a bespoke website to accompany small business <i>Tombstone Tapes</i>. To fit
                with the retro feel of redundant data formats, we decided to look back to the past and create a website
                inspired by Windows 95.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/paintcontainer.png" alt="An MS Paint style image container" \>

                    stylised after Paint</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Design</h5>
            <p>The design of the Tombstone Tapes homepage is inspired by Windows 95, with colours and fonts taken from
                the operating system.</p>
            <p>This gave us the opportunity to include fun elements on the website to interact with, such as a fully
                functional start menu complete with icons to external sites, displayed in 16-bit Windows colour palette,
                along with a real time clock along the task bar.</p>
            <p>The containers on the website are stylised after Windows 95 dialogue boxes, including image containers
                stylised after MS Paint containers.</p>
            <p>The website is fully responsive to work on mobile devices, and likewise the start menu is still fully
                functional.</p>

                <img src="assets/images/startmenu.png" alt="The start menu" \>
                <figcaption>Tombstone Tapes' homepage features a fully interactive start menu</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>Tombstone Tapes was an exercise in creating a website with a specific design brief, and was a great
                opportunity to learn more about working with CSS and responsive design. Creating a bespoke interactive
                start menu allowed me to create some fun elements and experiment with some simple JavaScript.</p>

            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>DOScord was created as a way to practice dynamic website creation using JavaScript. It aims to emulate
                the functionality of Discord, but with a fun DOS theme.</p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Website Structure</h5>
            <p>DOScord uses the CSS-grid layout to clearly define container areas within the page. This allows for
                easy, responsive design, and allows for the page to be easily split into sections.</p>

            <figure>

                <figcaption>One of the channels of DOScord</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h5>Dynamic Content</h5>
            <p>As with Discord, DOScord is divided into servers and channels, with each channel containing a number of
                messages. The content of each channel is dynamically generated using JavaScript. The data is sourced
                from several linked JSON files, which are parsed and used to generate the content as needed.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>DOScord was a great opportunity to practise working with JavaScript and a complex structure of JSON data.
                This allowed me to create a dynamic website with a clear structure, which I have been able to bring
                forward to future projects, such as the use of dynamic content on this website.</p>

            <h5>Future Plans</h5>
            <p>DOScord is currently a work in progress, with plans to add more content to the page for users to explore,
                along with additional features such as user profiles.</p>
