            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, I'm Edward Atkin. I've been working with code since I was around 11 years old when I decided I
                wanted
                to make my own games.</p>
            <p>I have experience in web development, scientific computing and game development, but more recently I am
                looking to specialise in the field of data science.</p>
            <p>I have learnt Data Science through Le Wagon's Data Science Bootcamp, which is one of the best rated
                bootcamps
                in the world.</p>

                        <h3>Horse Racing Predictor</h3>
                        <h4>Motivation</h4>
                        <h5>Inspiration</h5>
                        <p>My first step into the world of gambling was through matched betting - a no-risk methodology
                            to
                            using
                            Bookmaker
                            offers to guarantee profits.</p>
                        <p>Ever since I began using matched betting to make money, I have become interested in betting
                            systems and technically-driven approaches to gambling.</p>
                        <p>As is the case for almost all gamblers, my success was limited, and due to a general aversion
                            to
                            losing
                            money, I
                            eventually shelved the idea.</p>
                        <p>It wasn't until starting the Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp that some people mentioned their
                            interest
                            in
                            sports
                            betting. My
                            interest was piqued once again.</p>
                        <h5>Advantages of Machine Learning Methods</h5>
                        <p>Gambling is addictive. This is a very well known result, and it's very easy to get
                            emotionally
                            involved
                            with
                            it.
                            Losing can result in 'revenge betting'. It
                            can also result in over-analysing your losses to try find reasons where none exist, or
                            thoughts such as 'I
                            <i>almost</i>
                            won!'.
                        </p>
                        <p>A robo-betting strategy provided by a machine learning model removes a lot of these factors.
                            The
                            bettor
                            does not
                            have to review racecards, they do not have to think they made a bad decision and they do not
                            need to
                            analyse
                            their wins and losses.</p>
                        <p>Although emotions are not completely removed, the urges to overanalyse and seek revenge after
                            a
                            loss
                            is
                            no longer
                            a factor.</p>
                        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                        <h5>Objectives</h5>
                        <p>Create a model that is able to predict the outcome of horse races.</p>
                        <h5>Data Collection</h5>
                        <p>Horse racing data is difficult to get ahold of, with only a few patchy datasets on Kaggle
                            available.
                        </p>
                        <p>Searching Github I came across <a href="https://github.com/joenano/rpscrape"
                                target="_blank">RPScrape</a>, a
                            utility for scraping results from Racing Post. From this I gathered around 1.5 million
                            datapoints
                            for
                            use in
                            model training.</p>
                        <p>I have subsequently built automated systems which will scrape results daily, as up-to-date
                            data
                            is
                            crucial for
                            the accurate functioning of the models.</p>
                        <h5>Data Processing</h5>
                        <p>Horse racing data in isolation is almost useless, with no strong correlations with anything.
                            To
                            begin
                            making
                            sense of all the data, it requires history and context.</p>
                        <p>I engineered various features using Pandas built-in aggregation utilities. Features include
                            aggregations of horse's performance over its lifetime, alongside comparisons with its
                            competitors
                            within a race.</p>
                        <h5>Model Training</h5>
                        <p>As horse racing is notoriously difficult to predict with any consistency, machine learning
                            models
                            suffer
                            likewise, with overfitting being the biggest problem.</p>
                        <p>The benchmark for a model is around 13% precision. I arrived at this figure by running a
                            simulation which
                            randomly
                            picked one
                            horse from every race, resulting in a 13% success rate.</p>
                        <p>I have trained two separate models, a deep neural network and a random forest classifier,
                            which
                            are
                            both
                            able to
                            capture complex relationships within data.</p>
                        <p>By carefully balancing parameters, the neural network to predict winners with around 25%
                            success,
                            which
                            is a mild
                            success when compared to the benchmark.</p>
                        <p>My second model, using ensemble machine learning algorithms, allowed my model to hit around
                            60%
                            precision
                            on
                            predicting winners, but at the cost of providing a winning candidate only once a week on
                            average.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <h5>Does It Make Money? The Short Answer</h5>
                        <p>Yes. I have had success with my strategy. The nature of horse racing and its inherent
                            unpredictability
                            means that
                            I may suffer long drawdowns, however, the general trend is upwards and most days are winning
                            days.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Does It Make Money? The Long Answer</h5>
                        <p>We must be careful before we say a betting strategy is successful. Whilst trialling betting
                            strategies
                            over my
                            dataset, I found that merely randomly picking a horse from each race can occassionally
                            result in
                            enormous
                            profits (although most of the time it results in a loss).</p>
                        <p>There is no way to tell if the betting strategy is going to be successful forever, it is
                            merely
                            that
                            your
                            confidence increases the longer it is profitable.</p>
                        <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
                        <p>This project was a huge exercise in taking data with almost no meaningful features and
                            turning it
                            into
                            something
                            useful.</p>
                        <p>Upon completing my first model, which took me around a month, I found the results to be
                            disappointing. At
                            this
                            point, it would have been easy to give up and move on, but I instead tried to further my
                            domain
                            knowledge in
                            horse racing, which lead to reading about the <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyer_Speed_Figure" , target="_blank">Bayer Speed
                                Figures</a> used in Hong Kong races. Inspired by this I
                            created my own speed ratings to benchmark horses against, and this proved to be a crucial
                            piece
                            of
                            the
                            puzzle.
                        </p>
                        <h5>The Future</h5>
                        <h6>Automation</h6>
                        <p>This project is already automated to the point where a Bash script will gather results,
                            racecards, perform data processing, modelling and finally email the relevant
                            results to me.</p>
                        <p>This may be further automated with use of the cron utility and a system such as a Raspberry
                            Pi to host the service.</p>
                        <p>While bets are currently manually placed, Betfair Exchange has an API which can be utilised
                            to automate betting.

                        <h5>Inspiration</h5>
                        <p>I have been using coding problems to further my technical capabilities since I started
                            learning
                            Python. I also
                            use it to explore new languages and paradigms.</p>
                        <p>My platform of choice is <a href="https://www.codewars.com/about"
                                target="_blank">Codewars</a>,
                            and as I
                            racked up solutions I wanted a way to be able to extract them all.</p>
                        <p>As I was learning new concepts with Le Wagon, I decided to use this as an opportunity to
                            build a
                            web scraper and
                            data visualisation project with my newly learnt skills.</p>
                        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                        <h5>Project Objectives</h5>
                        <p>The primary goal of this project is to build a customised web scraper for Codewars problems
                            and
                            create an
                            interactive data visualisation notebook to accompany the problems.</p>
                        <h5>Data Collection</h5>
                        <p>Initially I built a static webscraper, requiring me to preload the page with the number of
                            problems I wanted to
                            scrape and save it locally. Codewars loads solutions dynamically, so as I solved more
                            problems,
                            this became more
                            cumbersome.</p>
                        <p>I later updated the scraper to use Selenium to login to Codewars using a headless browser and
                            simulate scrolling
                            to the bottom of the page. Beautiful Soup then parses all the problems, which are saved
                            locally and organised into folders based on the problem's programming language.</p>
                        <h5>Data Visualisation</h5>
                        <p>Instead of just leaving these scraped problems to sit archived on my hard disk, I decided to
                            bring it to life by
                            creating a Jupyter Notebook to visualise the data and explore interesting features.</p>
                        <p>By employing libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I'm able to visualise my problem
                            solving
                            behaviour over
                            time.</p>
                        <p>For example, I can see how many problems I solved each day, how many problems I solved in
                            each
                            language, and how
                            many problems I solved in each difficulty.</p>
                        <p>I also use the Codewars API to collect additional information about problems, which allows me
                            to
                            uncover novel
                            insights such as the 'rarest kata', the Codewars problem I've solved that has the least
                            solved,
                            or the 'most
                            difficult kata', the Codewars problem that has the lowest rate of completion.</p>
                        <h5>Impact and Future Steps</h5>
                        <p>This project forms the foundation for future explorations in coding challenges and data
                            analysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Jupyter Notebook can handle problems dynamically, meaning it is self-updating as I solve
                            more
                            problems.</p>
                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>My Codewars Web Scraper and Data Visualisation project shows my passion for coding, data
                            exploration, and
                            problem-solving.</p>
                        <p>The Jupyter Notebook is a great way to visualise the progress I've made and I look forward to
                            continuing to use
                            it as I
                            solve more problems.</p>

                    to maximise compatibility, which required some very creative use of CSS to create features such as

                <h3>Weird Indie Shit</h3>
                <p>Being an indie game developer has given me experience in the sheer difficulty of getting noticed, and
                    as
                    programming video games becomes more accessible day by day, more and more people are uploading their
                    games to share.</p>
                <p>After the observation that several hundred games are uploaded to Itch IO per day, most of which would
                    never be seen or played, I decided to embark on some indie game archaeology to discuss a few games
                    that
                    nobody has ever heard of.</p>
