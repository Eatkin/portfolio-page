            <h1>Edward Atkin</h1>
<p>I am a coding enthusiast who entered the world of digital creation at the age of 11, driven by a desire to
    bring my video game ideas to life.</p>
<p>With a dynamic array of technical skills, my educational background in Mathematical Physics drives my passion for
    programming and problem solving. From web development to data science, I'm always looking for fresh opportunities to
    stretch my abilities.</p>
<p>From the humble days of learning to code with Gamemaker 6 in the early 2000s, my path has brought me through
    to mastering the art of data science through Le Wagon's world-class data science bootcamp, and I'm now looking to
    apply my skills to a new challenge.</p>

            <h3>Horse Racing Predictor</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>My first step into the world of gambling was through matched betting - a no-risk methodology
                which uses Bookmaker offers to guarantee profits. This was what sparked my interest in betting systems
                and technically-driven approaches to gambling.</p>
            <p>Le Wagon's Data Science bootcamp connected me with other people who were interested in sports
                betting algorithms, and my interest was piqued once again.</p>

            <h5>Advantages of Machine Learning Methods</h5>
            <p>As gambling can be addictive, it is very easy to become emotionally involved and make bad decisions. A
                robo-betting strategy provided by a machine learning model removes the emotional decision making.
                The bettor does not have to review racecards or analyse horses, nor do they need to analyse their wins
                and losses.</p>
            <p>Although emotions are not completely removed, a machine learning driven methodology allows the bettor to
                focus on the long-term and not be swayed by short-term losses.</p>

                    shows the trade-off in sacrificing number of predictions for good precision.

            </figure>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Objectives</h5>
            <p>Create a model that is able to predict the outcome of horse races.</p>
            <p>Develop a betting strategy that can leverage the model's predictions to make a profit.</p>

            <h5>Data Collection</h5>
            <p>Horse racing data is difficult to find, with only a few patchy datasets on Kaggle
                available.</p>
            <p>Searching Github, I came across <a href="https://github.com/joenano/rpscrape"
                    target="_blank">RPScrape</a>, a utility for scraping results from Racing Post. From this I gathered
                around 1.5 million datapoints for use in exploratory data analysis model training.</p>
            <p>Using this, I have built automated systems which will scrape results daily, as up-to-date data is crucial
                for accurate model predictions.</p>

            <h5>Data Processing</h5>
            <p>Horse racing data in isolation is almost useless, with no features correlating with a horse
                winning. To begin making sense of all the data, it requires history and context.</p>
            <p>I engineered various features using <i>Pandas</i> built-in aggregation utilities, including
                aggregations of horse's performance over its lifetime, alongside comparisons with its
                competitors within a race.</p>

            <h5>Model Training</h5>
            <p>As horse racing is notoriously difficult to predict with any consistency, machine learning
                models suffer likewise, with overfitting being a major issue.</p>
            <p>My benchmark for a model was defined by by running a simulation which randomly picked one horse from
                every race, resulting in a 13% success rate.</p>
            <p>I have trained two separate models, a deep neural network and a random forest classifier, which are both
                able to capture complex relationships within data.</p>
            <p>By carefully balancing parameters, the neural network is able to predict winners with around 25%
                Precision, which is a mild success when compared to the benchmark.</p>
            <p>My second model, using ensemble machine learning algorithms, allowed my model to hit around 60% precision
                predicting winners, but at the cost of providing a winning candidate only once a week on average.
            </p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Does It Make Money? The Short Answer</h5>
            <p>Using a well defined betting strategy, my model is able to make a profit over time.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/candlesticks.png" alt="Candlestick chart showing profit over time" \>
                <figcaption>Candlesticks chart showing profit based on level Â£1 stakes
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h5>Does It Make Money? The Long Answer</h5>
            <p>Whilst trialling betting strategies over my dataset, I found that merely randomly picking a horse from
                each race can occassionally result in enormous profits (although most of the time it results in a loss).
            </p>
            <p>There is no way to tell if the betting strategy is going to be successful forever, it is merely that
                confidence increases the longer it is profitable.</p>

            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>This project was a huge exercise in taking data with almost no meaningful features and
                turning it into something useful.</p>
            <p>Upon completing my first model, which took me around a month, I found the results to be
                disappointing. At this point, it would have been easy to give up and move on, but I instead tried to
                further my domain knowledge in horse racing, which lead to reading about the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyer_Speed_Figure" , target="_blank">Bayer Speed
                    Figures</a> used in Hong Kong races. Inspired by this I
                created my own speed ratings to benchmark horses against, and this proved to be a crucial
                piece of the puzzle.</p>
            <p>This project is also the first time I have ensembled multiple models in order to play on the
                strengths of both. This works well with the domain of horse racing, as the difficulty in
                making consistent predictions means both models may complement each other. If one model
                performs poorly one day, the second model may be there to make up for it, and using results that both
                models agree on can be a good indicator of a strong candidate.</p>

            <h5>The Future</h5>
            <h6>Automation</h6>
            <p>This project is already automated to the point where a single Bash script will gather
                results and racecards, then perform data processing and modelling and finally email the
                relevant results to me so I have access to them remotely.</p>
            <p>This may be further automated with use of the cron utility and a system such as a Raspberry
                Pi to host the service.</p>
            <p>While bets are currently manually placed, Betfair Exchange has an API which can be utilised
                to automate betting.</p>

            <h3>Reddit Sentiment Analysis</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Project Outline</h5>
            <p>This project was our final group project at the Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp.</p>
            <p>Reddit is a social media platform where users can post content and interact with other users. It is a
                popular platform for discussion, with many subreddits dedicated to specific topics.</p>
            <p>The project outline was to analyse the sentiment and emotion of Reddit comments, specifically those
                posted on the infamous Wall Street Bets subreddit, which is dedicated to stock market discussion.</p>
            <p>The project was inspired by the recent GameStop short squeeze, which was driven by the Wall Street Bets
                subreddit.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/commentAnalysis.png" alt="A comment analysis" \>
                <figcaption>Analysing a user inputted comment</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Objectives</h5>
            <p>Create a system for collecting Reddit comments, then analyse the sentiment and emotion of the comments
                using Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p>
            <p>Present the results in a dashboard, which can be used to track the sentiment and emotion of the subreddit
                over time.</p>

            <h5>Under the Hood</h5>
            <p>The backend for the project for data collection and processing was written in Python, using the PRAW
                library for interacting with the Reddit API.</p>
            <p>Modelling was performed using transformers, a library for NLP tasks.</p>
            <p>The dashboard was created using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive dashboards.</p>
            <p>An API was created using FastAPI to allow the dashboard to interact with the backend.</p>

            </figure>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>This was my first experience of working on a group project, and aside from developing technical skills,
                it was a great opportunity to develop soft skills such as communication and teamwork.</p>
            <p>This was also my first experience of working on a live product, and as such I worked closely with
                deployment tools such as Docker and Google Cloud Platform services.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, this project introduced me to the practical side of data science, demonstrating how
                technical proficiency intertwines with user experience, performance optimisation, and scalability.</p>
            <p>The challenges of creating a live, dynamic project honed my problem-solving skills and deepened my
                understanding of cloud-based solutions.</p>

            <h5>The Future</h5>
            <h6>Further Development Potential</h6>
            <p>As this was a short lived project during a part time bootcamp, there is plenty of scope for further
                development.</p>
            <p>An automated data processing system proved to be a challenge, as the operations were very intensive and
                time consuming, meaning running this on Google Cloud Run was not feasible.</p>
            <p>The project could also benefit from utilising a cloud based database system such as Google BigQuery,
                which would
                allow for more efficient data storage and retrieval and allow the dashboard to be updated in real time.
            </p>
            <p>To enhance scalability and automation, Kubernetes could be explored for container orchestration.
                Leveraging Kubernetes would not only ensure the smooth operation of the project but also facilitate
                fully automated processes, reducing the need for manual intervention.</p>

            <h3>Codewars Web Scraper and Data Visualisation</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>I have been using coding problems to further my technical capabilities since I started
                learning Python and also use them as a way to explore new languages and paradigms.</p>
            <p>My platform of choice is <i><a href="https://www.codewars.com/about" target="_blank">Codewars</a></i>,
                and as I racked up solutions I wanted a way to be able to extract them all.</p>
            <p>As I was learning new concepts with Le Wagon, I decided to use this as an opportunity to build a web
                scraper and data visualisation project with my newly learnt skills.</p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Project Objectives</h5>
            <p>The primary goal of this project is to build a customised web scraper for retrieving <i>Codewars</i>
                problem
                solutions and create an interactive data visualisation notebook to accompany the problems.</p>
            <h5>Data Collection</h5>
            <p>Initially I built a static webscraper, requiring me to preload the page with the number of
                problems I wanted to scrape and save it locally. <i>Codewars</i> loads solutions dynamically, so as I
                solved
                more problems, this became more cumbersome.</p>
            <p>I later updated the scraper to use <i>Selenium</i> to login to <i>Codewars</i> using a headless browser
                and
                simulate scrolling to the bottom of the page. <i>Beautiful Soup</i> then parses all the problems, which
                are
                saved locally and organised into folders based on the problem's programming language.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/codewarsScraper.png" alt="Codewars scraper running in command line" />
                <figcaption>The Codewars Scraper is a command line based Python program</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h5>Data Visualisation</h5>
            <p>Instead of just leaving these scraped problems to sit archived on my hard disk, I decided to
                bring it to life by creating a <i>Jupyter Notebook</i> to visualise the data and explore interesting
                features.
            </p>
            <p>By employing libraries such as <i>Matplotlib</i> and <i>Seaborn</i>, I'm able to visualise my problem
                solving behaviour over time.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/codewarsDifficultyChart.png"
                    alt="Chart showing distribution of difficulties for each programming language" />
                <figcaption>Chart showing distribution of difficulties for each programming language
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>For example, I can see how many problems I solved each day, how many problems I solved in
                each language, and how many problems I solved in each difficulty.</p>
            <p>I also use the <i>Codewars</i> API to collect additional information about problems, which allows me
                to uncover novel insights such as the <i>'rarest kata'</i>, the <i>Codewars</i> problem I've solved that
                has
                the least
                solved, or the <i>'most difficult kata'</i>; the <i>Codewars</i> problem that has the lowest rate of
                completion.</p>

            <h5>Impact and Future Steps</h5>
            <p>This project forms the foundation for future explorations in coding challenges and data
                analysis.
            </p>
            <p>The Jupyter Notebook can handle problems dynamically, meaning it is self-updating as I solve
                more problems.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>My Codewars Web Scraper and Data Visualisation project shows my passion for coding, data
                exploration, and problem-solving.</p>
            <p>The <i>Jupyter Notebook</i> is a great way to visualise the progress I've made and I look forward to
                continuing to use it as I solve more problems.</p>

            <h6>Further Development</h6>
            <p>The <i>Codewars</i> scraper does not include any error trapping for if the user enters incorrect
                login credentials or if the scraper is comes across an unexpected programming language, as
                detailed below.</p>
            <p>The <i>Codewars</i> scraper contains a Python dictionary which matches programming languages to file
                extensions
                and comment syntax. This only contains the programming languages I have used on <i>Codewars</i> and may
                be
                extended to contain details for all programming languages <i>Codewars</i> offers.</p>

            <h3>Other Minds</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> draws its roots from philosophy, specifically looking towards the question; why are we
                ourselves, and why is understanding the consciousness of others so difficult? This is a concept in
                philosophy aptly knows as the problem of other minds - how do you know others experience consciousness?
            </p>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> is an exploration of this concept. You inhabit a character known as Ed, accompanied by
                a
                floating prescence called Sage who allows you to possess other entities in the game. Through this unique
                mechanic, the player can step into the shoes of other characters, use them to solve puzzles and advance
                the narrative of the game.</p>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> draw influence from <i>
                    <a href="http://autofish.net/clysm/art/video_games/seiklus/index.html" target="_blank">Seiklus</a>
                </i>, a
                cornerstone of Gamemaker's legacy. By combining the influence of this game with innovative gameplay
                mechanics, <i>Other Minds</i> is a game which allows the player to explore the concepts of consciousness
                and embark on an exploratary adventure.</p>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Modular Design</h5>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> is an expansive, open world 2d platformer. Modular, re-usable code was essential for
                streamlining the development process and allowing the game to be both scalable and amenable to the
                addition of new features.</p>
            <p>As the player is free to control any character, their abilities are determined by variables
                dictating speed, acceleration and jump height, alongside a list of boolean variables to determine which
                skills are accessible. Using a finite state machine, both the main character and various
                other characters, such as a bird, run on the same code, demonstrating how powerful this concept is.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/otherMindsGif.gif" alt="A challenging scenario in Other Minds" />
                <figcaption>A challenging scenario in Other Minds</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h5>Character AI</h5>
            <p>Character movement should be consistent whether the character has 'free will' or if the player is
                controlling them. To accomplish this, characters use simulated key presses to create movement. The game
                world is full of characters who are able to exhibit their unique behaviours and personalities, be it
                slimes who have fun jumping up and down, or a nervous character who paces back and forth. The use of
                simulating movement as if the player were controlling them allows this.</p>
            <p>This concept can allow for extremely complex emergent behaviour for characters. Of note is the first boss
                fight of the game where the player faces antagonist Dr Death. Upon defeating his machines, Dr Death
                himself runs into the boss arena to try and attack you. He is able to determine which platforms he can
                reach and calculate which is best for reaching his target; the player. A few simple rules allows the AI
                to become very complex.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> was my first large project after a long programming hiatus. Whilst this
                project does have somewhat organised code, my coding ability, code modularity and project management
                vastly improved over the course of the development process. This improvement is demonstrated in project
                such as <i><a href="https://eatkin.itch.io/ben-was-assimilated" target="_blank">Ben Was
                        Assimilated</a></i>, which made the process of adding new enemies or items to the game a
                case of adding one line of code, with the modular systems managing everything else.
            </p>
            <p>The game also required careful data management, for which I made use of bitmasking and
                data structures. Bitmasking is a powerful concept which I have used in almost every
                project since.</p>
            <p>The development process took place over the course of several years, and maintaining a project for
                that long can be difficult in terms of motivation. This taught me skills in large project management;
                maintaining an organised task list and breaking steps down into small, manageable chunks.</p>

            <h5>The Future</h5>
            <p><i>Other Minds</i> has an unknown future as a concept and no more work will be done on the game itself,
                however I have often considered making a sequel, or re-imagining, since my abilities have grown hugely
                since I first embarked on making this game. I would be able to combine everything I have learnt over the
                past few years to create a more immersive experience, with improved game mechanics and storytelling.</p>
            <p>The one large barrier is time - producing a project this large as a solo developer can be extremely
                consuming, especially when you are working fulltime alongside.</p>

            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p><i>Date &amp; Game</i> is a company integrating online games and dating into one app. Users match
                with other users and connect to play games together.</p>
            <p>I was the lead games programmer for the company, in charge of creating the online game framework to
                integrate with the <i>Date &amp; Game</i> API and programming gameplay.</p>
            <p>I collaborated with the app developers for API integration and worked alongside game designers and
                artists to create bespoke, two player experiences.</p>

                <figcaption>In <i>Route 69</i>, players use various tools to solve puzzles together - here they are
                    playing noughts and crosses together</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Online Games</h5>
            <p>I produced a robust framework using Gamemaker Studio 2 and Socket IO as the basis for all games.</p>
            <p>I created a variety of different games from <i>Route 69</i>, a game where players go on an adventure
                together, collecting key items to solve puzzles, to <i>PixlWave</i>, a vaporwave stylised game where
                players compete to complete pixel art drawings as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>

            <h5>Framework</h5>
            <p>To streamline the game development pipeline, I create an online game framework with a high level of
                modularity, allowing for the creation of new games with minimal effort. The basic framework allows
                players to send position and other variable updates and also keeps the game's world state synchronised,
                allowing for arbitrary resynchronisation - for example, if one player leaves the game, they are able to
                return and have the game state resynchronise so both players see the game in the same state.</p>

            <h5>Technical Details</h5>
            <p>Online games pose their own unique problems due to latency. For example, one player may pick up an item,
                then the other player may pick up the same item before the signal that the item has been picked up.
                These sort of conflicts arise constantly and methods must be implemented for clean resolution.</p>
            <p>I implemented various techniques to ensure the robustness of the framework and to optimise performance.
                This involved the use of three way handshakes, exponential backoff and data-encoding.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/dungeondate.png" alt="Dungeon Date" \>
                <figcaption>In <i>Dungeon Date</i>, players collaborate to escape the dungeon, choosing how to split
                    their loot.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Data management was crucial, due to the requirement of arbitrary resychronisation. Data structures were
                put in place along with encoding methods to allow players to seamlessly send large amounts of data
                easily and only where necessary.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>Despite initially having no experience with online game development and having a steep learning curve
                before me, I created robust systems and used creative problem solving to resolve any conflicts that
                arise as a result of latency to ensure smooth synchronisation of the games I developed.</p>
            <p>I also transferred the systems from Gamemaker Studio 2 to Unity, a system for which I previously had
                little familiarity with.</p>

            <h3>Personal Homepage</h3>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <h5>Inspiration</h5>
            <p>Over the years I've worked on a lot of games, pieces of music, and other projects, and I wanted a
                place to host and write about these projects.</p>
            <p>I have deep sense of nostalgia for the Web 1.0 era, a time when hosts like <i>Freewebs</i> and
                <i>Geocities</i> proliferated. These websites had a charming, amateur quality with a distinct personal
                touch which left an impression on the viewer.
            </p>
            <p>Inspired by this, I chose to use web hosting service <i>
                    <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank">Neocities</a>
                </i>, the spiritual successor to <i>Geocities</i>.</p>

                <figcaption>An example of a blog post</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <h5>Neocities</h5>
            <p><i>Neocities</i> is a free web hosting service that allows users to create their own websites. It is a
                successor to <i>Geocities</i>, a web hosting service that was popular in the 90s and early 2000s.</p>
            <p>When a user creates a site on <i>Neocities</i>, they are provided with one file, <i>index.html</i>.</p>
            <p>From there, the user can create more files and folders to build up a website. These were the first steps
                I took into front end web development, creating a simple and bold site, with minimal javascript to
                maximise compatability.</p>

            <h5>Tools</h5>
            <p>As my site grew, I developed tools in Python to dynamically generate pages for me. For example,
                my games pages contains over 30 games with a variety of tags and CSS-based filtering. To create or
                update this page, I run a Python script which will automatically parse json data and generate html and
                accompanying css.</p>
            <p>Chronologically updated pages such as my blog also have accompanying tools to automate building
                pages and updating links and RSS feeds.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/games.png" alt="Games page" />
                <figcaption>An example of the games page with CSS-based filtering</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h5>Neocities API</h5>
            <p>As my site grew, uploading pages manually became cumbersome, so I have built file-tracking and automation
                tools that use the <i>Neocities</i> API to update any pages as necessary. Site updates are now as simple
                as running a Python script.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>Neocities was my first foray into front end web development, and was the cornerstone of my
                interest in web development in general. From here I have built up the website and accompanying
                automation tools to streamline the process of web development and deployment, and this has been the
                foundation I needed to continue working with web development projects.</p>

                fully functional start menu, complete with icons to external sites and displayed in 16-bit Windows
                colour palette, along with a real time clock along the task bar.</p>
            <p>The containers on the website are Windows 95 dialogue boxes, including image containers
                stylised after MS Paint containers.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h5>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h5>
            <p>Tombstone Tapes was an exercise in creating a website with a specific design brief. This website was not
                only a platform to develop new skills with CSS and responsive design, but was also an opporunity to work
                with interactive elements.</p>
            <p>By designing the website around Windows 95 user interface elements and crafting a bespoke, interactive
                start menu, I was able to develop my skills in Javascript, and create a unique website to promote a
                small, unique business.</p>

            Weird Indie Shit
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>Being an indie game developer has given me experience in the sheer difficulty of getting your games noticed. As
        programming video games becomes increasingly accessible, the rate at which games are uploaded is constantly
        accelerating.</p>
    <p>Upon making the observation that several hundred games are uploaded to <a href="https://www.itch.io/"
            target="_blank"><i>Itch io</i></a> every day, most of
        which would never be seen or played, I decided to embark on some indie game archaeology to discuss a few games
        that nobody has ever heard of.</p>
