Things to do for responsive design:
There's a hidden header with class project-title-hidden that should only show with small screens
There should also be a hidden description below and mouse-over image animations should be disabled
Div widths should be widened
Clicking project title should open the overlay as well as clicking the image
Overlays should have a close button at the top right corner
Js needs updating for this stuff
