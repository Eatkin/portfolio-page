    <h1>Codewars Web Scraper and Data Visualisation</h1>

    <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>I have been using coding problems to further my technical capabilities since I started learning Python. I also
        use it to explore new languages and paradigms.</p>
    <p>My platform of choice is <a href="https://www.codewars.com/about" target="_blank">Codewars</a>, however as I
        racked up solutions I wanted a way to be able to extract them all.</p>
    <p>As I was learning new concepts with Le Wagon, I decided to use this as an opportunity to build a web scraper and
        data visualisation project with my newly learnt skills.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
    <p>The primary goal of this project is to build a customized web scraper for Codewars problems and create an
        interactive data visualisation notebook to accompany the problems.</p>

    <h3>Data Collection</h3>
    <p>Initially I built a static webscraper, requiring me to preload the page with the number of problems I wanted to
        scrape and save it locally. Codewars loads solutions dynamically, so as I solved more problems, this became more
        cumbersome.</p>
    <p>I later updated the scraper to use Selenium to login to Codewars using a headless browser and simulate scrolling
        to the bottom of the page. Beautiful Soup then parses all the problems and stores them in a Pandas dataframe and
        exports them for later usage.</p>

    <h3>Data Visualisation</h3>
    <p>Instead of just leaving these scraped problems to sit archived on my hard disk, I decided to bring it to life by
        creating a Jupyter Notebook to visualise the data and explore interesting features.</p>
    <p>By employing libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I'm able to visualise my problem solving behaviour over
        time.</p>
    <p>For example, I can see how many problems I solved each day, how many problems I solved in each language, and how
        many problems I solved in each difficulty.</p>
    <p>I also use the Codewars API to collect additional information about problems, which allows me to uncover novel
        insights such as the 'rarest kata', the Codewars problem I've solved that has the least solved, or the 'most
        difficult kata', the Codewars problem that has the lowest rate of completion.</p>

    <h3>Impact and Future Steps</h3>
    <p>This project forms the foundation for future explorations in coding challenges and data analysis.</p>
    <p>The Jupyter Notebook can handle problems dynamically, meaning it is self-updating as I solve more problems.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>My Codewars Web Scraper and Data Visualisation project shows my passion for coding, data exploration, and
        problem-solving.</p>
    <p>The Jupyter Notebook is a great way to visualise the progress I've made and I look forward to continuing to use
        it as I
        solve more problems.</p>
