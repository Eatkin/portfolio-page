    <h1>Horse Racing Predictor</h1>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>My first step into the world of gambling was through matched betting - a no-risk methodology to using Bookmaker
        offers to guarantee profits.</p>
    <p>Ever since I began using matched betting to make money, I have become interested in betting
        systems and technically-driven approaches to gambling.</p>
    <p>As is the case for almost all gamblers, my success was limited, and due to a general aversion to losing money I
        eventually shelved the idea.</p>
    <p>It wasn't until starting the Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp that some people mentioned their interest in sports
        betting. My
        interest was piqued once again.</p>

    <h3>Advantages of Machine Learning Methods</h3>
    <p>Gambling is addictive. This is a very well known result. It's very easy to get emotionally involved with it.
        Losing can result in 'revenge betting'. It
        can also result in over-analysing your losses to try find reasons, or thoughts such as 'I <i>almost</i> won!'.
    </p>
    <p>A robo-betting strategy provided by a machine learning model removes a lot of these factors. The bettor does not
        have to review racecards, they do not have to think they made a bad decision and they do not need to analyse
        their wins and losses.</p>
    <p>Although emotions are not completely removed, the urges to overanalyse and seek revenge after a loss is no longer
        a factor.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>Create a model that is able to predict the outcome of horse races.</p>

    <h3>Data Collection</h3>
    <p>Horse racing data is difficult to get ahold of, with only a few patchy datasets on Kaggle available.</p>
    <p>Searching Github I came across <a href="https://github.com/joenano/rpscrape" target="_blank">RPScrape</a>, a
        utility for scraping results from Racing Post. From this I gathered around 1.5 million datapoints for use in
        model training.</p>
    <p>I have subsequently built automated systems which will scrape results daily, as up-to-date data is crucial for
        the accurate functioning of the models.</p>

    <h3>Data Processing</h3>
    <p>Horse racing data in isolation is almost useless, with no strong correlations with anything. To begin making
        sense of all the data, it requires history and context.</p>
    <p>I engineered various features using Pandas built-in aggregation utilities. Features include aggregations of
        horse's performance over its lifetime, alongside comparisons with its competitors within a race.</p>

    <h3>Model Training</h3>
    <p>As horse racing is notoriously difficult to predict with any consistency, machine learning models suffer
        likewise, with overfitting being the biggest problem.</p>
    <p>The benchmark is around 13% precision. I arrived at this figure by running a simulation which randomly picked one
        horse from every race, resulting in a 13% success rate.</p>
    <p>I have trained two separate models, a deep neural network and a random forest classifier, which are both able to
        capture complex relationships within data.</p>
    <p>By carefully balancing parameters, the neural network to predict winners with around 25% success, which is a mild
        success when compared to the benchmark.</p>
    <p>My second model, using ensemble machine learning algorithms, allowed my model to hit around 60% precision on
        predicting winners, but at the cost of providing a winning candidate only once a week on average.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <h3>Does It Make Money? The Short Answer</h3>
    <p>Yes. I have had success with my strategy. The nature of horse racing and its inherent unpredictability means that
        I may suffer long drawdowns, however, the general trend is upwards and most days are winning days.</p>

    <h3>Does It Make Money? The Long Answer</h3>
    <p>We must be careful before we say a betting strategy is successful. Whilst trialling betting strategies over my
        dataset, I found that merely randomly picking a horse from each race can occassionally result in enormous
        profits (although most of the time it results in a loss).</p>
    <p>There is no way to tell if the betting strategy is going to be successful forever, it is merely that your
        confidence increases the longer it is profitable.</p>


    <h3>Personal Growth and Lessons Learnt</h3>
    <p>This project was a huge exercise in taking data with almost no meaningful features and turning it into something
        useful.</p>
    <p>Upon completing my first model, which took me around a month, I found the results to be disappointing. At this
        point, it would have been easy to give up and move on, but I instead tried to further my domain knowledge in
        horse racing, which lead to reading about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyer_Speed_Figure" ,
            target="_blank">Bayer Speed Figures</a> used in Hong Kong races. Inspired by this I
        created my own speed ratings to benchmark horses against, and this proved to be a crucial piece of the puzzle.
    </p>

    <h3>The Future</h3>
    <h4>Automation</h4>
    <p>This project is already automated to the point where I simply press "Run All" in a Jupyter Notebook, which will
        gather results, racecards, perform data processing, modelling and finally email the relevant results to me.</p>
    <p>This may be further automated with use of the cron utility and a system such as a Raspberry Pi to host the
        service.</p>
    <p>While bets are currently manually placed, Betfair Exchange has an API which can be utilised to auto-bet.</p>
